# Welcome to Inward Lens 🌌

**Inward Lens** is an experiment in self-reflection.  
It lets you have a conversation with a version of yourself — a mirror that speaks back, adapted with some of your features.  
The idea is simple but powerful: we all have important questions in life, and often the answers are already within us.  
This project helps you search for them by **talking to yourself**.
